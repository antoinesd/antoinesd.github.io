Today, I'm proud to announce the first release of the brand new project https://github.com/swarmic[Swarmic^] (version 1.0.0.Alpha1).

Swarmic is a mix of CDI extension and tooling to create standalone CDI application on Java SE.
It can be used to build desktop application, Microservices or batch process.

It is directly inspired by http://wildfly-swarm.io/[WildFly Swarm] and reuse some of its concepts like fractions.
The project also comes from John Ament's Hammock project who donated his code to Swarmic.

Swarmic uses CDI as an integration backbone and as a programming model at the same time.
The good side of this approach makes the produced fat jars rather small.
Downside is the usage of a flat class loader preventing some advanced and nice stuff that we have in WildFly Swarm.

Swarmic aim CDI 2.0 and uses last Weld 3.0 Alpha version.
The idea is avoid being tied to Weld and give feature usable on others CDI 2.0 implementations

== Why Swarmic

As you may know CDI 2.0 will support Java SE bootstrap at spec level.
But what is the interest of such a feature if user don't have integration with basic services like persistence or Rest exposition?

So the first mission of Swarmic is to propose the glue code to integrate these services that were available in Java EE.

The second mission of this project and the most important is to create high level CDI extension or integration code for major framework out there.
This ecosystem creation will benefit all platform supporting CDI (Java EE, Java SE or OSGi).

The third and last mission is the "enhance our own dog food" mission.
By putting Swarmic on the edge of technology (CDI 2.0, Java 9), we'll be able to test and experiment the future of the spec and implementations.
Like static code generation, InvokeDynamic usage or others.

== One programming model to unite them all

Swarmic is the missing link to make CDI cross platformin whole Java world.

By making it's programming model usable everywhere user can always take right platform for their needs nad keep their using their knowledge.

* You need something small start with Swarmic.
* Your needs grows and you want more features and better monitoring, go for WildFly Swarm.
* Your project need to run on a standardized platform switch to Wildfly
* You need professional support, Jboss EAP is your choice.

In all the cases, CDI stay the same and provides (nearly) the same.

== What's in this version ?

This first alpha version of Swarmic provides the following fractions:

* Web-Undertow: provides servlet engine based on UnderTow
* Web-Jetty: provides servlet engine based on Jetty
* Camel: support of Camel thru camel-cdi
* Rest-RestEasy: support of Jax-RS with RestEasy implementation
* JPA-Hibernate: support of JPA  with Hibernate implementation
* JTA-Narayana: support of JTA (transactions) with Narayana
