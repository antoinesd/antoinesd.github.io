I'm a french guy, working at Red Hat as a senior software engineer.
I'm the leader for the Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) 2.0.

I also do a lot of evangelism on CDI in conference like Java One, Devoxx or various Jug.

I'm also writing a lot of doc and article on CDI and its eco-system.

You can follow me on https://twitter.com/antoine_sd[twitter^] and https://fr.linkedin.com/in/antoinesabotdurand[LinkedIn^].

When I'm not coding or writing technical stuff I spend most of my time with my wife and 3 kids.
